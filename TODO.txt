to do
URGENT TO DO
(maybe will do)
// will not do
    done

bugs:
    continuous line when poping from stack (see plant.ls.svg)
GAPS BETWEEN STARTING OF NEW BRANCHES
peano and hilbert curves look weird
crash with only one or no .ls files

organizational:
    remove support for eva the school server (static linking of libstdc++ and usage of g++6)
    rename program name and title
    separate source and object files
    create needed folders in makefile
    reduce cflags to only really neccessary (remove -g, maybe also -fno-builtin)
    write readme / help
    add license
SUBMIT FOR 2.TIME
add separate input files into [L-system] and [Draw-info] sections and read them into separate objects
separate source and header files
(rewrite to using oop gtkmm)

l-system:
    set default values for parameters
change axiom to be string, not only one character
add colour rule to LS definition to change colour gradually in model path
add more l-system features (@, |) to render tiling from lecture 12, p.71
polygons? ({.})
support for change of:
- line color
- angle of rotation
- line width
- line length

saving:
    save as svg
    fit svg picture to center

examples:
    remove x and y parameters
    add close close path parameter
    peano curve
dragon curve
gosper curve
penrose tiling

rendering:
    separate whole picture into more paths (e.g. close path when poping/pushing from/to stack) - in svg there is currently one huge path
    close path at the end if specified

gui:
// 2 combo boxes: subfolders and particular l-systems in them, as in java 3D_Lsystems
    increase/decrease iteration of L-System and redraw - buttons up and down
    support for tree structures (and turtle stack)
    zoom/move drawings to fit to draw area (and so drawing does not move when changing iteration)
    // - draw to unbounded recording surface https://cairographics.org/manual/cairo-Recording-Surfaces.html
    // - get extents of recording surface
    // - for gtk drawing area use cairo_scale(), cairo_translate() to fit the drawing to window
    // - for svg create surface with size of those extents (or also make maximum size and scale then)
    // or
    - get extents of paths
dynamic size of draw area (according to display size)
show draw_string
- make draw_string text view scrollable with word wrap:
- https://developer.gnome.org/gnome-devel-demos/stable/textview.c.html.en
default folder for l-systems will be ../l-systems (but user should be able to choose different)
changing background and foreground (lines) colours
interactive change of L-System definition in program
add parameter for joining lines of some L-Systems (to have start and end point connected)

generating:
limit size of generated string
(cache already generated strings, of one L-System yet)
// animations?
// 3D graphics?
